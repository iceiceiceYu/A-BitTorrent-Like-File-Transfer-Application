Welcome to Network Project !

There are totally four scripts (check points) for you to pass through, have a good trip!

The entry of this project is peer.c in starter_code. After you have implemented it, you need to make it and copy the binary code to each checkpoint folder, and check if you have passed each of them.

Those plagiarize will be reported to both Prof. Li and your advisor, I suggest not to waste time doing such things.

Best wishes !
